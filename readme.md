# Deep Reinforcement Learning

Course assignments of the Deep Reinforcement Learning course offered at New York University during the Fall of 2020.

* Instructor: Prof. Lerrel Pinto
* Course Assistant: Ishan Khanka

The 4 assignments can be found in the 4 folders in this repository root. To quickly summarize the assignments:
1. Solve a standard ML task related to classifying tabular data
2. Solve Open AI's CarRacing-v0 using **Immitation Learning**. Also, solve the Gambler Problem as an Markov Decision Process [Unavailable].
3. Solve Open AI's CarRacing-v0 using **Deep-Q Network**. Then solve it using DQN with **Priority Experience Replay**
4. Solve Open AI's CartPole-v1 using Policy Gradient methods - **Reinforce** & **Proximal Policy Optimization**


The 2nd assignment is well documented, so I recommend that one if you have time for only one. **Link:** [https://github.com/SohamTamba/DeepRL/tree/master/2%20-%20Immitation%20Learning/Racing](https://github.com/SohamTamba/DeepRL/tree/master/2%20-%20Immitation%20Learning/Racing). As the semester progresses, free time become more and more rare :(
